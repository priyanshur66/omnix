# omniX

*omniX* is a health-focused platform that gamifies daily wellness routines. By setting goals and creating groups, users are incentivized to achieve their health objectives. Group creators (admins) earn a share of the group fee, motivating them to keep members engaged and healthy.

## Our Solution

omniX promotes healthy living by:

- Gamifying health goals, encouraging user engagement.
- Offering group health challenges where admins innovate activities and goals.
- Redistributing group fees based on individual performance, boosting motivation.

## How It Works

1. Admins create a group, set health goals, and a joining fee.
2. Users pay the fee and strive to meet those goals.
3. At the month’s end, the fee pool is distributed based on goal completion, making health fun and rewarding.

## Problem Statement

According to the reports of *WHO, India faces a high burden of lifestyle diseases, which account for **60% of all deaths. Diseases like **diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease* have seen a sharp rise, especially due to inactive lifestyles and unhealthy habits. The majority of these conditions can be significantly reduced through mindful daily habits.
