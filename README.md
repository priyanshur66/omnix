# omniX

omniX is a health-focused platform built on Base that gamifies daily wellness routines using blockchain technology. By setting goals, creating and joining groups (Clubs), users are incentivized with crypto rewards (USDT on Base Sepolia for this demo) to achieve their health objectives. Group creators (admins) earn a share of the group joining fees, motivating them to design engaging challenges and keep members healthy.

## Problem Statement

According to reports from the **WHO**, India faces a high burden of lifestyle diseases, which account for **60% of all deaths**. Diseases like **diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease** have seen a sharp rise, especially due to inactive lifestyles and unhealthy habits. The majority of these conditions can be significantly reduced through mindful daily habits. omniX aims to tackle this by making healthy habits fun, social, and rewarding.

## Our Solution

omniX promotes healthy living by:

*   **Gamifying Health Goals:** Turning wellness routines into engaging challenges with clear objectives and rewards.
*   **Group Health Challenges (Clubs):** Enabling users to join or create clubs with specific health goals (e.g., running, walking, sleep quality). Admins are incentivized to innovate activities and goals.
*   **Crypto Incentives:** Utilizing smart contracts on the Base blockchain to automatically redistribute club joining fees based on individual performance, boosting motivation and accountability.
*   **Seamless Onboarding:** Leveraging Coinbase Smart Wallet and Base Name Service (BaseNS) for easy wallet connection and user identification.

## How It Works (The Mechanics)

1.  **Club Creation:** Admins create a Club, define specific health goals (e.g., minimum steps, calories burnt, sleep hours), set rules, and establish a joining fee (in USDT).
2.  **Joining a Club:** Users browse available Clubs and join by paying the fee using their connected crypto wallet.
3.  **Goal Achievement:** Users strive to meet the Club's health goals within the set timeframe (e.g., daily, monthly). Progress can be tracked (simulated in the demo via manual input, intended for integration with fitness trackers).
4.  **Reward Distribution:** At the end of the period (simulated as daily in the demo, typically monthly), the smart contract automatically distributes the fee pool. Users who meet their goals receive a significant portion of their joining fee back, while the Club admin receives the remainder as a reward for creating and managing the group.

    *   Approve the transaction in your wallet.
    *   The smart contract executes: a percentage of your joining fee (e.g., 80% or 8 USDT in the demo) is returned to your wallet balance. The remaining percentage (e.g., 20%) is sent to the Club admin.
    *   Your progress bars will reset for the next period.
